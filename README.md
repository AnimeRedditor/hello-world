# hello-world
First tutorial repo on this account

Hello random internet strangers reading this!
I have a bit of experience in Java and C#, and I'm a huge fan of open-source! 
You can find me on Reddit (of course - my username is TheAnimeRedditor by the way), Steam (I love Rainbow 6: Siege and PUBG!), Twitter, and a couple more places.
